# Creating 3D models for manufacturing

Presentation files for 3D modeling

## Introductory

Have you ever wondered what to do with our 3D printer? You are not solely interested to download junk from thingiverse.com ending up as a landfill, but instead you have a problem to solve IRL.

We talk some background, and have few examples how to turn your model in to a physical object covering services with 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC milling. We also run through the basics of parametric modeling, and then get our hands dirty with the software.

You need a computer (MacOS or Windows, sorry no Linux) running Fusion 360, or you can pair up with a friend.
